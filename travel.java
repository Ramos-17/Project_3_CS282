/*
Quick Travel – Class: Travel
Type of graph: Weighted directed
Goal: From a starting planet to a destination planet, find the fastest path (least total weight).
Algorithm hint: This is a Single-Source Shortest Path problem — you should use Dijkstra’s algorithm.
Input: travel.txt – contains directed edges like Earth Mars 50.
Output: The path from source to destination and the total travel time.
