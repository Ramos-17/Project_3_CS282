//Patrol
/*
1. Secure Paths – Class: Patrol

Type of graph: Weighted undirected
Goal: Find a way to connect all planets (nodes) with patrol routes (edges) such that the total patrol cost is minimized.
Algorithm hint: This is a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem — you likely need to implement Prim’s or Kruskal’s algorithm.
Input: patrol.txt – contains undirected edges like Earth Mars 50.
Output: The patrol edges and the total cost.
